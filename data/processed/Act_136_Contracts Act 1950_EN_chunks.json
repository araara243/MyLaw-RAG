A breaks his promise. B is entitled to receive from\nA, by way of compensation, the sum, if any, by which the contract price falls\nshort of the price for which B might have obtained 50 gantangs of saltpetre of\nlike quality at the time when the saltpetre ought to have been delivered.\n(b) A hires B’s ship to go to Telok Anson, and there take on board, on the\n1st of January, a cargo, which A is to provide, and to bring it to Port Dickson,\nthe freight to be paid when earned. B’s ship does not go to Teluk Intan, but A\nhas opportunities of procuring suitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms as\nadvantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship. A avails himself of\nthose opportunities, but is put to trouble and expense in doing so. A is entitled\nto receive compensation from B in respect of the trouble and expense.\n(c) A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 gantangs of rice, no time\nbeing fixed for delivery. A afterwards informs B that he will not accept the rice\nif tendered to him. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation the\namount, if any, by which the contract price exceeds that which B can obtain for\nthe rice at the time when A informs B that he will not accept it.\n(d) A contracts to buy B’s ship for RM60,000, but breaks his promise. A\nmust pay to B, by way of compensation, the excess, if any, of the contract price\nover the price which B can obtain for the ship at the time of the breach of\npromise.\n(e) A , the owner of a boat, contracts with B to take a cargo of tin to\nSingapore, for sale at that place, starting on a specified day. The boat, owing\nto some avoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed, whereby the\narrival of the cargo at Singapore is delayed beyond the time when it would have\narrived if the boat had sailed according to the contract. After that date, and\nbefore the arrival of the cargo, the price of tin falls. The measure of the\ncompensation payable to B by A is the difference between the price which B\ncould have obtained for the cargo at Singapore, at the time when it would have\narrived if forwarded in due course, and its market price at the time when it\nactually arrived.\n(f) A contracts to repair B’s house in a certain manner, and receives\npayment in advance.

B\nunreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A, in consequence, loses\na profitable contract with the Government.

C fails to perform his contract with A, who\ncannot procure other iron, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. C must\npay to A RM20,000, being the profit which A would have made by the\nperformance of his contract with B.\n(k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day, for a\nspecified price, a certain piece of machinery.

A builds the\nhouse so badly that, before the 1st of January, it falls down and has to be rebuilt\nby B, who in consequence, loses the rent which he was to have received from\nC, and is obliged to make compensation to C for the breach of his contract. A\nmust make compensation to B for the cost of rebuilding the house, for the rent\nlost and for the compensation made to C.\n(m) A sells certain merchandise to B, warranting it to be of a particular\nquality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it to C w ith similar\nwarranty. The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes\nliable to pay C a sum of money by way of compensation. B is entitled to be\nreimbursed this sum by A.\n(n) A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A does not\npay the money on that day. B, in consequence of not receiving the money on\nthat day, is unable to pay his debts and is totally ruined. A is not liable to make\ngood to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay, together with\ninterest up to the day of payment.\n50 Laws of Malaysia ACT 136\n(o) A contracts to deliver 50 gantangs of saltpetre to B on the 1st of January,\nat a certain price. B afterwards, before the 1st of January, contracts to sell the\nsaltpetre to C at a higher price than the market price of the 1st of January. A\nbreaks his promise. In estimating the compensation payable by A to B, the\nmarket price of the 1st of January, and not the profit which would have arisen\nto B from the sale to C, is to be taken into account.\n(p) A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales of cotton to B on a fixed day.\nA knows nothing of B’s mode of conducting his business. A breaks his promise,\nand B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill. A is not responsible to B\nfor the loss caused to B by the closing of the mill.\n(q) A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on the 1st of January, certain cloth\nwhich B intends to manufacture into caps of a particular kind, for which there\nis no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not delivered till after the\nappointed time, and too late to be used that year in making caps. B is entitled\nto receive from A, by way of compensation, the difference between the contract\nprice of the cloth and its market price at the time of delivery, but not the profits\nwhich he expected to obtain by making caps, nor the expenses which he has\nbeen put to in making preparation for the manufacture.\n(r) A , a shipowner, contracts with B to convey him from Kelang to Sydney\nin A’s ship, sailing on the 1st of January, and B pays to A, by way of deposit,\none-half of his passage-money. The ship does not sail on the 1st of January, and\nB, after being, in consequence, detained in Kelang for some time, and thereby\nput to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, in consequence,\narriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum of money. A is liable to repay to B his\ndeposit, with interest, and the expense to which he is put by his detention in\nKelang, and the excess, if any, of the passage-money paid for the second ship\nover that agreed upon for the first, but not the sum of money which B lost by\narriving in Sydney too late.\nCompensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated\nfor",
