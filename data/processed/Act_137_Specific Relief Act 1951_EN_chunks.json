C dies insolvent and the\nofficial receiver claims the annuity from A. The court, on finding it clearly\nproved that the parties always intended that this annuity should be paid as\na provision for B and her children, may rectify the settlement and decree that\nthe official receiver has no right to any part of the annuity.\nPresumption as to intent of parties\n\n31.
