## Q001: What is the definition of 'consideration' under Malaysian contract law?
**Status**: ❌ Retrieval Failed

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 2(d)
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec Preamble), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 2), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 24)

### Ground Truth Answer
> When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: Consideration is defined as an act, abstinence, or promise made at the desire of the person making the proposal (the promisor). It is what the promisee (the person accepting the proposal) or another person does or refrains from doing, or promises to do or refrain from doing, in exchange for the promise (Contracts Act 1950, Section 2(d)).
2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "when, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 2(d)).
3.  **Explanation**: In simpler terms, consideration is something of value that is exchanged between parties in a contract. It can be an action, a promise not to do something, or something of value. For example, if someone promises to sell you a car, and you promise to pay them money, the money is the consideration for the car, and the car is the consideration for the money.

## Q003: What is 'free consent' in contract law?
**Status**: ✅ Retrieval Success

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 14
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 14), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 10), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 12)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: "Free consent" means that the agreement to a contract was not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake (Contracts Act 1950, Section 14). Consent is considered to be caused by these factors if the agreement would not have been made without them (Contracts Act 1950, Section 14).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake (Contracts Act 1950, Section 14).
    *   Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for the existence of such coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake (Contracts Act 1950, Section 14).

3.  **Explanation**: In simpler terms, for a contract to be valid, the agreement must be made willingly and without any pressure or deception. If someone is forced, tricked, or mistaken into agreeing, then their consent is not "free."

4.  **Disclaimer**: This information is based on the provided legal texts and is for informational purposes only. For specific legal advice, please consult with a qualified legal professional.

## Q004: When can a contract be specifically enforced?
**Status**: ❌ Retrieval Failed

**Retrieved Sources**: Specific Relief Act 1951 (Sec 19), Specific Relief Act 1951 (Sec 20), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 34)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Specific performance of a contract shall be enforced when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation in money for its non-performance would not afford adequate relief, or when there exists no standard for ascertaining compensation.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: A contract can be specifically enforced even if a sum is named in the contract to be paid in case of a breach, and the party in default is willing to pay it (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 19).
2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "A contract, otherwise proper to be specifically enforced, may be so enforced, though a sum be named in it as the amount to be paid in case of its breach, and the party in default is willing to pay the same" (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 19).
3.  **Explanation**: Specific enforcement means a court order that compels a party to fulfill the terms of a contract. Even if the contract includes a penalty for breaking it, the court can still order the contract to be carried out as agreed, as long as it is otherwise appropriate.

## Q005: What are the licensing requirements for housing developers in Malaysia?
**Status**: ❌ Retrieval Failed

**Expected Source**: Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 5
**Retrieved Sources**: Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Sec 2), Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Sec 1), Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Sec 24)

### Ground Truth Answer
> No person shall engage in or carry on or undertake or cause to be undertaken a housing development unless he is in possession of a licence issued under this Act.

### Generated Answer
I cannot find the specific licensing requirements for housing developers in the provided legal texts. However, the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 addresses the licensing of housing developers (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Part II). It states that housing development is prohibited except by virtue of a license (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 5). The Act also outlines conditions or restrictions for the grant of a license (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 6).

## Q006: What is 'undue influence' in a contract?
**Status**: ✅ Retrieval Success

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 16
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 16), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 179), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 20)

### Ground Truth Answer
> A contract is said to be induced by undue influence where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: Undue influence in a contract occurs when one party is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to gain an unfair advantage (Contracts Act 1950, Section 16(1)).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "A contract is said to be induced by “undue influence” where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 16(1)).

3.  **Explanation**: This means that if one person has power over another and uses that power to make the other person agree to a contract that is not fair to them, it is considered undue influence. For example, if someone uses their authority or a position of trust to pressure another person into a contract that benefits them unfairly, that contract could be voidable.

## Q007: What is fraud under the Contracts Act?
**Status**: ✅ Retrieval Success

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 17
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 17), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 191), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec Preamble)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Fraud includes acts committed with intent to deceive or induce a person to enter into a contract, such as suggestion of fact which is not true, active concealment of fact, promise without intention of performing, or any other act fitted to deceive.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: Fraud, in the context of a contract, includes specific deceptive acts committed by a party to the contract, their agent, or with their connivance. These acts are intended to deceive another party or their agent, or to induce them to enter into the contract (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "Fraud” includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17).
    *   (a) the suggestion, as to a fact, of that which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true; (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17)
    *   (b) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact; (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17)
    *   (c) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17)
    *   (d) any other act fitted to deceive; and (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17)
    *   (e) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent. (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17)

3.  **Explanation**: Fraud involves actions intended to mislead someone into entering a contract. This can include making false statements, hiding important information, promising something without the intention of following through, or any other action designed to deceive. However, simply remaining silent about facts that might affect someone's willingness to enter a contract is not fraud, unless there's a duty to speak or the silence itself is equivalent to a statement (Contracts Act 1950, Section 17).

## Q008: When is an agreement void for uncertainty?
**Status**: ✅ Retrieval Success

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 30
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 28), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 30), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 25)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Agreements the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: An agreement is void for uncertainty if its meaning is not certain or cannot be made certain (Contracts Act 1950, Section 30).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 30).

3.  **Explanation**: This means that if the terms of an agreement are vague, unclear, or open to multiple interpretations, the agreement is not legally binding. For example, an agreement to sell "a hundred tons of oil" without specifying the type of oil would be void for uncertainty (Contracts Act 1950, Section 30, Illustration (a)). However, if the context clarifies the meaning, such as specifying "one hundred tons of coconut oil" if the seller only deals in coconut oil, the agreement is valid (Contracts Act 1950, Section 30, Illustration (c)).

    *   "‘Housing Development Account’ means an account opened and maintained by a licensed housing developer pursuant to section 7 A" (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 4).
    *   "Subject to subsection (9), every licensed housing developer shall open and maintain a Housing Development Account with a bank or finance company for each housing development undertaken by the licensed housing developer" (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 7A(1)).
3.  **Explanation**: A "licensed housing developer" is a developer who has been granted a license to carry out housing development (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 4). This account is specifically for each housing development project.

## Q010: Can a contract in restraint of trade be enforced?
**Status**: ✅ Retrieval Success

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 28
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 28), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 34), Specific Relief Act 1951 (Sec 20)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Every agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind, is to that extent void.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: Agreements that restrict someone's ability to engage in trade are generally not enforceable (Contracts Act 1950, Section 28). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as agreements related to the sale of a business's goodwill or agreements between partners (Contracts Act 1950, Section 28).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "Agreement in restraint of trade void" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 28)
    *   Exception 1— Saving of agreement not to carry on business of which goodwill is sold;
    *   Exception 2— of agreement between partners prior to dissolution;
    *   Exception 3— or during continuance of partnership (Contracts Act 1950, Section 28)

3.  **Explanation**:
    *   An agreement in restraint of trade means an agreement that prevents someone from carrying out their profession or business. The law generally considers these agreements void, meaning they cannot be enforced.
    *   However, there are exceptions. For example, if you sell the goodwill (reputation and customer base) of your business, you might agree not to open a similar business in the same area. This type of agreement is usually enforceable. Agreements between partners are also subject to different rules.

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "Any housing developer who—(a) in contravention of subsection 5(1) engages in, carries out, or undertakes housing development without having been duly licensed under that section;... shall be guilty of an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand ringgit but which shall not exceed five hundred thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both" (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 18).

3.  **Explanation**: This means that if a housing developer starts a housing project without first obtaining the required license, they have committed a crime. If found guilty in court (conviction), they will face a fine, imprisonment, or both.

## Q012: When can specific performance be refused?
**Status**: ❌ Retrieval Failed

**Expected Source**: Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 20
**Retrieved Sources**: Specific Relief Act 1951 (Sec 21), Specific Relief Act 1951 (Sec 43), Specific Relief Act 1951 (Sec 14)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person who has become incapable of performing, or violates, any essential term of the contract.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: A court may refuse to order specific performance (a court order to fulfill a contract) in several situations. This is at the court's discretion (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 21(1)). The court may refuse if the contract gives the plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant, even without fraud (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 21(2)(a)). The court may also refuse if fulfilling the contract would cause hardship to the defendant that they did not foresee, while not fulfilling it would not cause hardship to the plaintiff (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 21(2)(b)). Specific performance also cannot be enforced against a party if the consideration they would receive is grossly inadequate, if their agreement was obtained through misrepresentation, concealment, or unfair practices, or if their agreement was given due to a mistake of fact (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 27).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   The jurisdiction to decree specific performance is discretionary (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 21(1)).
    *   The court may refuse specific performance if the circumstances give the plaintiff an unfair advantage (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 21(2)(a)).
    *   The court may refuse specific performance if it would cause hardship to the defendant (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 21(2)(b)).
    *   Specific performance cannot be enforced if the consideration is grossly inadequate, if assent was obtained through misrepresentation, or if assent was given under a mistake (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 27).

3.  **Explanation**: The law gives the court the power to decide whether or not to order someone to specifically perform a contract. This means the court can decide if someone must do what they promised in the contract. The court will consider the fairness of the situation and the potential impact on both parties.

4.  **Disclaimer**: This information is based on the provided legal excerpts and is for informational purposes only. You should seek professional legal advice for specific situations.

## Q013: What makes an agreement without consideration valid?
**Status**: ✅ Retrieval Success

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 26
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 25), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 26), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec Preamble)

### Ground Truth Answer
> An agreement without consideration is void unless it is in writing and registered, or is a promise to compensate for something done, or is a promise to pay a debt barred by limitation law.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: An agreement made without consideration (something of value exchanged between parties) is generally void (invalid). However, there are three exceptions where such an agreement is valid:
    *   If it is in writing and registered, and made because of natural love and affection between people closely related to each other (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26(a)).
    *   If it is a promise to compensate someone who has already voluntarily done something for the promisor, or something the promisor was legally required to do (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26(b)).
    *   If it is a written promise, signed by the person making the promise (or their authorized agent), to pay a debt that the creditor could have enforced, but is now prevented by a law limiting the time to sue (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26(c)).

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "An agreement made without consideration is void, unless—" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26)
    *   "(a) it is expressed in writing and registered under the law (if any) for the time being in force for the registration of such documents, and is made on account of natural love and affection between parties standing in a near relation to each other;" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26(a))
    *   "(b) it is a promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done something for the promisor, or something which the promisor was legally compellable to do; or" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26(b))
    *   "(c) it is a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits." (Contracts Act 1950, Section 26(c))

3.  **Explanation**:
    *   **Consideration** is something of value that each party gives to the other in a contract. For example, in a sale, the consideration for the seller is the money, and the consideration for the buyer is the item being sold.
    *   An agreement without consideration is generally not legally binding. However, the law makes exceptions for certain situations, such as agreements based on love and affection between family members, promises to compensate for past services, and written promises to pay old debts.

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   “Misrepresentation” includes—
        *   the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true (Contracts Act 1950, Section 18(a));
        *   any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gives an advantage to the person committing it, or anyone claiming under him, by misleading another to his prejudice, or to the prejudice of anyone claiming under him (Contracts Act 1950, Section 18(b)); and
        *   causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement (Contracts Act 1950, Section 18(c)).

3.  **Explanation**: Misrepresentation is when someone provides false information or makes misleading statements that influence another person to enter into a contract. This can be done intentionally or unintentionally. It can also involve a breach of duty that leads someone to be misled.

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   A perpetual injunction may be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favor of the applicant (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 52(1)).
    *   When an obligation arises from a contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter II (Specific Relief Act 1951, Section 52(2)).

3.  **Explanation**: An injunction is a court order that compels a party to do, or refrain from doing, a specific act. A perpetual injunction is a permanent order. If a contract is breached, the court may grant an injunction to prevent the breach.

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 21
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 21), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 22), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 179)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: If both parties involved in an agreement are mistaken about a crucial fact related to the agreement, the agreement is considered void (Contracts Act 1950, Section 21). This means the agreement has no legal effect.

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   "Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void" (Contracts Act 1950, Section 21).

3.  **Explanation**: This means that if both parties are wrong about a fundamental fact that is central to their agreement, the law will treat the agreement as if it never existed. For example, if someone agrees to sell a horse, but the horse was already dead at the time of the agreement, and neither party knew, the agreement is void (Contracts Act 1950, Section 21, Illustration (b)).

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: The Controller of Housing has several powers, including the power to grant or refuse licenses to housing developers, impose conditions on those licenses, and revoke or suspend a license under certain circumstances. The Controller can also delegate powers and functions to other officers.

2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   The Controller may grant or refuse to grant a license to a housing developer (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 5(4)).

3.  **Explanation**: The Controller of Housing is a key figure in regulating housing developers. A "license" is permission to engage in housing development (Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, Section 5). The Controller can decide whether to give a developer a license, and if so, can set rules (conditions) for that license. If a developer acts improperly, the Controller can take away (revoke) or temporarily stop (suspend) their license. The Controller can also allow other officers to carry out some of their duties.

**Expected Source**: Contracts Act 1950, Section 27
**Retrieved Sources**: Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 28), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec 1), Contracts Act 1950 (Sec Preamble)

### Ground Truth Answer
> Every agreement in restraint of the marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void.

### Generated Answer
1.  **Direct Answer**: Agreements that prevent someone from getting married are generally not valid (void), except for agreements that restrain a minor (a person under the age of 18) from marrying during their minority (Contracts Act 1950, Section 27).
2.  **Legal Basis**:
    *   Every agreement in restraint of the marriage of any person, other than a minor during his or her minority, is void (Contracts Act 1950, Section 27).
3.  **Explanation**: This means that if someone makes an agreement that stops another person from getting married, that agreement is not legally enforceable. However, this does not apply to minors.
4.  **Disclaimer**: This response is based on the plain reading of the statute and is for informational purposes only. For specific legal advice, please consult a lawyer.
